# The Journey of Building Curious Context Companion

## Starting with Lovable for Boilerplate

I began this project by using Lovable to generate the initial boilerplate code. Lovable was incredibly useful for setting up the foundational structure of the project:

1. **Modern UI Framework**: Lovable provided a ready-to-use React application with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, which gave me a sleek and modern interface to start with.

2. **Project Structure**: The boilerplate included proper directory structure for a web application, separating components, hooks, and pages in an organized manner.

3. **Configuration Files**: All the necessary configuration files for TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, and Vite were automatically set up, saving hours of configuration work.

4. **Package Management**: The package.json file included all the essential dependencies and proper scripts for development, building, and linting.

## Expanding with Cursor for Custom Features

After establishing the foundation, I used Cursor's AI-powered coding capabilities to implement the custom features that make Curious Context Companion unique:

1. **Flask Backend Development**: Used Cursor to write the Python Flask backend code:
   - Created the main app.py with T5 model integration for summarization
   - Implemented ChromaDB integration for storing and retrieving document embeddings
   - Added API endpoints for summarization, recommendations, and citation generation
   - Wrote an alternate backend implementation using Ollama for flexible AI model options

2. **Chrome Extension Features**:
   - Developed the content extraction script for grabbing text from web pages
   - Built the popup interface with dynamic loading states and error handling
   - Implemented the communication between the extension and local backend
   - Added adjustable summary length controls

3. **AI Model Integration**:
   - Wrote the code to load and use the T5 model for summarization
   - Implemented Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings
   - Created the integration with Ollama as an alternative backend
   - Optimized the models for better performance on consumer hardware

4. **Debugging and Optimization**:
   - Used Cursor's help to identify and fix various bugs in the code
   - Optimized the performance of the AI models to reduce response time
   - Improved error handling throughout the application

5. **Enhanced Summary Formatting**:
   - Implemented intelligent summary formatting with headings and paragraphs
   - Added NLTK sentence tokenization to properly structure summaries
   - Created regex-based heuristics to identify headings and key points
   - Built responsive HTML rendering for formatted summaries in the extension UI
   - Enhanced the clipboard functionality to maintain formatting when copied

## Challenges and Solutions

### Memory Management Challenge
When first running the T5 model, I encountered memory issues on machines with limited RAM.

**Solution**: Used Cursor to help implement batching of large texts and model optimizations, significantly reducing memory usage.

### Cross-Origin Requests
Initially, the Chrome extension couldn't communicate with the local Flask server due to CORS issues.

**Solution**: With Cursor's guidance, I implemented proper CORS headers and configured the extension manifest to request appropriate permissions.

### Model Loading Time
The first-time loading of AI models was taking too long and creating a poor user experience.

**Solution**: Cursor helped implement asynchronous model loading and add better feedback in the UI to inform users when models are being loaded for the first time.

### Summary Readability Issues
Early versions produced summaries as a single block of text that were difficult to read and comprehend quickly.

**Solution**: Used Cursor to develop smart formatting that converts flat text into structured output with clear headings and paragraphs, improving readability and information retention.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Lovable for Speed**: Using Lovable for boilerplate generation saved days of setup work, allowing me to focus on the unique aspects of the project.

2. **Cursor for Complex Logic**: Cursor's AI assistance was invaluable when implementing the more complex parts of the application, especially when integrating multiple AI models and dealing with asynchronous operations.

3. **Hybrid Approach**: The combination of Lovable for structure and Cursor for implementation proved to be extremely efficient. The structured foundation from Lovable made it easier for Cursor to assist with more complex features.

4. **Learning Through Building**: Working with AI tools like Lovable and Cursor actually enhanced my understanding of the technologies used, as I could focus more on how things work rather than boilerplate details.

5. **UX Focus**: Investing time in formatting and presentation (with Cursor's help) greatly improved the user experience without requiring massive code rewrites.

## Future Directions

With the foundation laid through Lovable and the complex features implemented with Cursor's help, I plan to:

1. Add support for more AI models through the Ollama integration
2. Implement collaborative features for research teams
3. Create a document organization system within the extension
4. Add support for more citation formats
5. Improve performance further with more optimized model loading
6. Enhance the formatting algorithm to better identify semantic structure in summaries

The combined power of Lovable for rapid setup and Cursor for intelligent coding assistance made this project possible in a fraction of the time it would have taken using traditional methods.
